I studied Mechanical Engineering  in school and took my first dive into programming with MATLAB. I learned the basics of Matlab over a weekend and created a project to simulate and visualize the orbits of planets around our solar system. This project peaked me interest and kick started my transition into the world of software engineering. A few years later, I spend my weekends building new projects and learning new frameworks!

I'd love love to work on a tight knit team where I can make a meaninful impact as well as collaborate with others. If you're hiring, let's chat!
